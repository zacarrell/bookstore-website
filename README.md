# bookstore-website
A final project for my ASP .NET course 
A bookstore simulation that uses session variables and XML databases.
Guests and bookstore members can view what is available in the bookstore, but only administrators can edit the list of items the bookstore sells. Admins can add, delete, and search for items in the database.

Shopping cart functionality was planned, but not implemented. (I might add it soon.)
