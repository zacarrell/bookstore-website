# Bookstore-Website
Final project for my ASP .NET course

A bookstore simulation that uses session variables and XML databases.  
Guests and bookstore members can view what is available in the 
bookstore, but only administrators can edit the list of items it 
sells.  Admins can add, delete, and search for items in the 
database.

Shopping cart's functionality was planned, but not implemented.  (I might 
add it soon.)
